# Goose-Chase
Collection of small projects used for a wild goose chase

## Why

Our friend group has a tradition that started while we were studying where we would excessively wrap gifts in anything we could find - Platic shopping bags, packaging tape, nylon rope, etc...

The giftee would then need to open their present using only their hands.

This project was an attempt to bring the concept into the digital world.
